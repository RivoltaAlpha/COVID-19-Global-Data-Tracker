# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project that tracks global COVID-19 trends including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. This project leverages real-world data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- ✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
- ✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
- ✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

📊 Insights & Reflections
📈 The USA had one of the highest case and vaccination counts globally.

🇮🇳 India experienced significant case spikes in early and mid-2021.

🇰🇪 Kenya showed a relatively slower but consistent rise in cases and vaccinations.

💉 Vaccination progress varied widely across countries, with high-income nations achieving faster rollout.

📌 Data visualization significantly helps in understanding the magnitude and timing of pandemic waves across regions.
